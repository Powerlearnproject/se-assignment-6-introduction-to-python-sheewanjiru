 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
     
     Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

   - Key features:
     Easy to learn and use- Has simple syntax that mimic natural language.
     Intrepreted language- Execute code line by line thus makes debugging easier.
     Versatile and powerful- It supports programming paradigms.
     Has extensible libraries and frameworks- Has libraries like numpy, pandas and matplotlib.
     Can perform basic operations like arithmetic operations and string manipulation.
     
   - Examples where it is effective;
     Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask are popular for building scalable web applications quickly.
     Data Science and Machine Learning: Python's libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch are widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and AI applications.
     Scripting and Automation: Python's ease of use and platform independence make it ideal for writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks and system administration.
     Prototyping and Rapid Application Development: Python's quick development cycle and extensive libraries are advantageous for prototyping new software ideas

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
  
   - Step to install python on the Os:
     Go to the python website and download the latest version.
     Run the installer and follow the on-screen steps up to the last step.
     Open a terminal or command prompt and check the version of the python installed.

   - Verifying installation and set up of virtual environment:
     Navigate to thefolder you want to have the virtualenv.
     Using a terminal or command prompt run install virtualenv using pip .
     Create the virtualenv using the prefferd name.
     Activate the virtualenv depending on the opereting system like windows (venv\Scripts\activate) and linux and mac os (source                venv/bin/activate) then verify it.
     To exit the virtualenv simply enter "deactivate"

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
     
     Simple python program;
     # Simple Python program to print Hello, World!
         print("Hello, World!")

     Basic syntax elements:
     1. Comments- It starts with a # and ignored by python interpreter and are used to add explanation.
     2. Print statement which outputs the specified message that is enclosed with parantheses.
     3. Strings which contains the information you want to display and is enclosed in single or double quotes.
        
4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
     
   - Basic data types:
     Integer (int): Represents whole numbers without any decimal point.
     Float (float): Represents real numbers with a decimal point.
     String (str): Represents sequences of characters, enclosed in single quotes ' or double quotes ".
     Boolean (bool): Represents truth values True and False.
     List: Represents an ordered collection of items, which can be of different types.
     Tuple: Similar to lists but cannot be changed.

   - Demonstation example:
# Define variables of different data types
# Integer
age = 25

# Float
weight = 60

# String
name = "Shawn Shon"

# Boolean
is_student = True

# List
grades = [80, 90, 88, 92]

# Tuple
coordinates = (10.5, 20.7)

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

     Conditional statements in Python are used to execute code based on certain conditions. They iclude; if, elif, and else.

   - Examples of if-else:
   - if-else statement allows you to execute a block of code if a condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false.
     like; age = 20
           if age >= 18:
             print("You are an adult.")
           else:
             print("You are a minor.")

     Loops in Python are used to iterate over a sequence like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string and execute a block of code repeatedly.

   - Example of a for loop:
      fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
       for fruit in fruits:
       print(fruit)

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

     Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They help to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts and promote code reuse, making programs easier to read, maintain, and debug.

   - Python function:
     # Function definition
     def add_numbers(a, b):
     "Returns the sum of two numbers."
       return a + b
     # Calling the function
     result = add_numbers(10, 15)
     print(f"The sum of 10 and 15 is {result}.")  # Output: The sum of 10 and 15 is 25.

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
  
   - Differences between list and dictionaries:
    1. Lists are ordered where they maintain an order of elements while dictionaries do not maintain an order up to python 3.7.
    2. Lists are index-based thus elements can be accessed by their index while dictionaries are key-based thus elements are accesed via keys.
    3. Dictionary keys must be unique while list require the index.

   - A script example;
 # Create a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Create a dictionary with some key-value pairs
person = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'age': 30,
    'city': 'New York'
}

# Basic operations on the list
# Add an element
numbers.append(6)
print("After appending 6:", numbers)

# Remove an element
numbers.remove(3)
print("After removing 3:", numbers)

# Access an element by index
second_element = numbers[1]
print("Second element:", second_element)

# Iterate through the list
print("Iterating through the list:")
for num in numbers:
    print(num)

# Basic operations on the dictionary
# Add a new key-value pair
person['profession'] = 'Engineer'
print("After adding profession:", person)

# Remove a key-value pair
del person['age']
print("After removing age:", person)

# Access a value by key
name = person['name']
print("Name:", name)

# Iterate through the dictionary
print("Iterating through the dictionary:")
for key, value in person.items():
    print(key, ":", value)
    

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
  
   Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to handle runtime errors, allowing a program to continue executing or gracefully exit. It involves using try, except, and finally blocks to catch and manage exceptions.
   try block: Contains code that might throw an exception.
   except block: Catches and handles the exception.
   finally block: Executes code regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.
   
 - Example:
   def divide(a, b):
    try:
        result = a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
        print("Exception message:", e)
    except TypeError as e:
        print("Error: Both arguments must be numbers.")
        print("Exception message:", e)
    else:
        print("Division result:", result)
    finally:
        print("Execution of the 'try except' block is complete.")
   # Example usage
divide(10, 2)
divide(10, 0)
divide(10, 'a')

Output:
Division result: 5.0
Execution of the 'try except' block is complete.
Error: Cannot divide by zero.
Exception message: division by zero
Execution of the 'try except' block is complete.
Error: Both arguments must be numbers.
Exception message: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'int' and 'str'
Execution of the 'try except' block is complete.
 
9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
  
    A module in Python is simply a file containing Python definitions and statements. Modules help to break down large programs into small, manageable, and organized files. They can define functions, classes, and variables, and can also include runnable code.

    A package is a way of organizing related modules into a single directory hierarchy. Packages are implemented as directories that contain a special file named __init__.py, which distinguishes a package from a regular directory. This file can be empty, or it can contain initialization code for the package.

 - How to import and use a module in your script:
   Import the entire module- You can then access the module's functions and variables using the module_name.function_name syntax.
   Import specific attributes from a module- This allows you to use function_name directly without the module name prefix.
   Import all attributes from a module- This imports all functions, classes, and variables from the module.
   
11. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
   
    - Reading from files in python: To read from a file in Python, you can use the open function along with the read method.
      
    - Example:
      # Reading from a file and printing its content to the console
file_path = 'example.txt'  # Replace with your file path
try:
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"The file {file_path} does not exist.")
except IOError:
    print(f"An error occurred while reading the file {file_path}.")

   1.open(file_path, 'r'): Opens the file in read mode ('r').
   2.file.read(): Reads the entire content of the file.
   3.with statement: Ensures the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.
    
    - Writing to a file: To write to a file in Python, you can use the open function along with the write method.
    
    - Example:
      # Writing a list of strings to a file

file_path = 'output.txt'  # Replace with your file path
lines_to_write = ["Hello, world!", "This is a test file.", "Writing to files in Python is easy."]

try:
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        for line in lines_to_write:
            file.write(line + '\n')
    print(f"Content successfully written to {file_path}.")
except IOError:
    print(f"An error occurred while writing to the file {file_path}.")

    1.open(file_path, 'w'): Opens the file in write mode ('w'). If the file does not exist, it will be created. If it does exist, its content will be truncated.
    2.file.write(line + '\n'): Writes each line to the file, adding a newline character at the end.
    3.with statement: Ensures the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.
